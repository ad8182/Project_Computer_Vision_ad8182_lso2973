This private repository is the academic group project worked on by Lily O'Carroll <lso2973> and Andrew Dantone <ad8182>, written for CSCI-431 [Computer Vision] taught by Dr. Thomas Kinsman, at Rochester Institute of Technology during the Spring 2023-2024 semester.
This group project took in a dataset of gemstones, located them within the image, and cropped out images of a specific size with the gemstones. This is so that they can be used within an artificial neural network that attempts to identify given gemstones.
Both files in this project are written in MATLAB. process_images.m crops gemstones and writes out the cropped gemstone images into a new directory, while GemStoneID_lso2973_ad8182.m trains and runs the artificial neural network to identify randomly given gemstones.
